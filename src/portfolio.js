  description:
    'Currently working at L3Harris in Texas with a strong background in software development, digital design, and electrical engineering. I originally learned to program in 2008 and have since learned to write software in many different programming languages in a variety of environments including web, mobile, native, system, and embedded. I received my MSE in computer and electrical engineering in 2021 where I gained experience implementing and accelerating algorithms on FPGAs, GPUs, and DSPs. Since graduation I have been lucky enough to design, develop, and test a core component of the world\'s first deep-space radiation-hardened ethernet switch that will be used in a mission-critical capacity for the Artemis missions. I\'ve also been able to significantly contribute to a constellation of satellites that will soon be competing with Starlink, as well as a several defense related projects.',
